```payload.bat``` gets loaded by a batchfile (soon to be exe) on the PC and then it opens the ```Trust.exe```.
```Trust.exe``` will now look for roblox in your local dir and deleate it, also will move its self to startup!

THIS IS FOR BLOCKING ROBLOX ONLY, DO NOT USE THIS FOR HARMING PEOPLE OR THEIR PROPERTIY!
